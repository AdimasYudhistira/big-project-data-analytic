## Result (Insight)
### Conclusions & Recommendations

**Conclusions**
- The majority of Task Force talent is predominantly located in Western Indonesia (Java & Sumatra).
- Most candidates have work experience levels as follows: beginner (43.8%), intermediate (34.9%), expert (16.4%), and no experience/fresh graduates (4.8%).
- On average, candidates and applicants know the company through LinkedIn. However, about 70% of candidates have not filled out how they learned about the company, so from the remaining 30%, most candidates know the company through LinkedIn.
- The majority of candidates come from the "Others" industry (39%), followed by Logistics/Forwarder (36.3%), Expedition (18.5%), Shipping (3.4%), and Trucking (2.7%).
- The comparison chart shows a difference between those who switched careers to logistics and those who did not, which is only 0.07%. Of these, 44.4% chose to switch to logistics, 43.7% chose to stay in their previous profession, and the rest are unknown.
- The top 5 most applied positions are Outbound Supervisor, Sales Executive, Program Office Intern, Sales & Business Development, and Finance & Tax Officer.
- Viewer interaction is highest on Instagram Reels content with a percentage of 58.7%.

**Recommendations**
- Expand (diversify) to Eastern Indonesia (Sulawesi & Papua).
- The company can design training and development programs to support the growth and skill enhancement of candidates with different levels of experience.
- To address the issue of candidates not filling out how they learned about the company, the company can increase form filling incentives, clarify the benefits of the form, strengthen transparency, and ensure the form is user-friendly.
- The company can increase interaction and exposure through relevant content, regular updates, engaging material, and active community involvement on LinkedIn.
- The company can expand its recruitment network in the Logistics/Forwarder and Expedition industries to diversify candidate backgrounds.
- The company can conduct further analysis and interviews with employees who have made career changes. Additionally, the company can evaluate opportunities to enhance its offerings or career development programs specifically in logistics to attract employees interested in switching careers.
- The company can hold seminars, training, or create content related to the most applied positions as an attraction strategy.
- The company can increase the amount of Instagram Reels content due to its high viewer interaction. To improve performance on other channels, the task force can take the following actions:
  - For Live Instagram, develop show-type content.
  - For Instagram Stories, create content with the category "update news".
  - For Instagram Posts, develop content with the category "celebration".
